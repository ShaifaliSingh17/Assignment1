# Node.js Number Processing API for demo assignment

## Requirements
A client is using a dashboard. He inputs a number from 1 to 25 {For eg - 5}. That number automatically gets multiplied by 7. 
1) If final number after multiplied by 7, is greater than 140, then its goes to file A. 
2) If final number after multiplied by 7, is greater than 100, then its goes to file B
3) If final number after multiplied by 7, is greater than 60 then its goes to file C. 
4) And all other numbers goes to file D

Once a number is stored in all files (A to D), the user canâ€™t enter any new number and the process gets complete 


## Features

- Uses `morgan` for logging requests with rotating file streams.
- Limits incoming requests to prevent abuse.
- Provides an endpoint to view stored numbers.

```bash
git clone nodejs-assignment
